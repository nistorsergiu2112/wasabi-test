The purpose of this app is to open up a modal on the wasabi exchange background that blurs the surroundings and creates a pixel-perfect representation of the Figma design.
To avoid unnecessary logic, i made the popup appear on image click instead of the button from the swap like on Wasabi mainly because that would have implied I recreated every component in the background. I think it wasn't the purpose of this example.

Tech stack used:
create-react-app with typescript
tailwind css for styling
vercel for hosting
Figma tools to inspect and understand measurements

I created a 1920 x 1080 to fit most screens

Responsiveness was ignored. In an ideal situation, i would have had mobile screens, different breakpoints designs etc.

Everything is static, the popup component is pure react no library was used.
